                            The purpose of a website is to reach new customers and keep current ones engaged. 
                            Therefore, customer-first should be at the top of your list for design features. 
                            After all, without your clients, your business won't grow or succeed.

                            Customer-first has been a buzzword for a few years now. 
                            In a nutshell, it's easy to imagine what customer-first design means. 
                            The needs of consumers come before anything else. 
                            However, the concept isn't quite as simple in practice. 
                            A lot of nuances enter the equation.

                        So what is a cooking blog exactly?
                        Cooking blogs are a type of food blog where bloggers share recipes, cooking tips, product reviews, and brand reviews for their readers.
                        Usually, there are separate tabs for each of these types of content for easy reading.
                        
                        Each cooking blog generally has a niche.

                        Thanks to the shelter-in-place restrictions, 
                        a lot of us have been stepping into the kitchens a lot more. 
                        For some of us, this might be the very first time as well.
                        As a new cook, while you're learning to cook, 
                        there are often some roadblocks that we run into. 
                        Salvaging those, needs Google,
